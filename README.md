# IOT_Based_Gas_and_Fire_Detector
This repo contains the code for a gas and fire detector which sends you notification on your smartphone. The code can be flased into an esp32/esp8266 via Arduino-IDE.
Hardware used are an ESP8266 microcontroller dev-board, A gas-detection-sensor, and an IR-sensor to detect fire.
Your mobile hotspot needs to be renamed as "Gas_Fire_Detector" and password to none so that auto connect functionality works.
Rest of the connection is mentioned in the code.
Additionally this project uses "ThingSpeak IOT" platform to send notifiction request to 'IFTTT' apps server.
